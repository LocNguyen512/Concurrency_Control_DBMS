# Lock_Mechanisms_DBMS
- Hi! This is my project in Database Management System subject.
- This project uses a real-world case study to demonstrate transaction management and lock mechanisms in SQL Server to resolve concurrent data access conflicts. 
- The project will also discover how deadlock was recognized in SQL Server.

## Project Requirements
Database: SQL Server
Transactions: SQL-based transactions with appropriate lock settings to resolve conflicts.

## Features
Transaction Management: Demonstrates a series of SQL transactions and isolation levels to control concurrent data access.
Lock Mechanisms: Includes row-level, page-level, and table-level locks to protect data integrity during concurrent operations.
Deadlock Detection: Showcases how SQL Server detects and resolves deadlocks through Trace Flags, SQL Profiler, and Extended Events.
